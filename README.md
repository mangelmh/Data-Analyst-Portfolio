# Data-Analyst-Portfolio

This repository contains projects I completed while taking courses on the Udemy platform and from Alex The Analyst on YouTube.
You will find how I conducted data exploration and cleaning using the SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) tool to work with databases. Regards!

# Project 1

The first project consists of transforming the data with the SSMS tool to discover the countries most affected by covid in South America, using SQL commands, in addition to comparing the data of infected people with those vaccinated. The data was extracted from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
